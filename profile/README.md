# Static Analyses of Program Flows: Types and Certificate for Complexity

StATyCC stands for "Static Analyses of Program Flows: Types and Certificate for Complexity." This is a two-year international collaborative project funded by the Thomas Jefferson Fund and involving the School of Computer Science of the University of Augusta and the Northern Paris Computer Science Lab of the University of Paris 13.

The project aims at providing new static analysis tools based on theoretical results from Implicit computational complexity, building on previous work of Moyen, Rubiano and Seiller [1]. It revolves around certified compositional analysis of source code, loop optimization through an original dependency model. Application to parallel optimization and intermediate representation are currently being investigated.
